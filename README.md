## Project Requirements Met

- [x] Product grid using CSS Grid
- [x] Hover effects on products
- [x] Filter/sort UI (no functionality)
- [x] Responsive product cards
- [x] Product images, titles, prices
- [x] Add to cart buttons


## Design Choices

used CSS grid for the product layout because its easy and works good. made it responsive with media queries at 768px and 480px breakpoints. 

colors are blue (#3498db) for buttons and green (#27ae60) for prices. kept it simple.

## Browser Compatibility

works on:
- Chrome ✓

tested on my laptop and not my phone due to lacking a phone

## Known Issues

- filter buttons don't actually filter (need javascript)
- sort dropdown doesn't work (need javascript) 
- add to cart doesn't do anything (need javascript)
- its all just UI right now

## Future Improvements

if i had more time:
- add javascript for filters
- make cart actually work
- add dark mode maybe
- product detail pages
